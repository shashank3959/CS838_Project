    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The captions also need to be pre-processed and prepped for training. In this example, for generating captions, we are aiming to create a model that predicts the next token of a sentence from previous tokens, so we turn the caption associated with any image into a list of tokenized words, before casting it to a PyTorch tensor that we can use to train the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand in more detail how COCO captions are pre-processed, we'll first need to take a look at the `vocab` instance variable of the `CoCoDataset` class.  The code snippet below is pulled from the `__init__` method of the `CoCoDataset` class:\n",
